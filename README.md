# Node.js Server Unintentional Closure/Crash Before Response

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Node.js where a server might unexpectedly close or crash before sending a complete response to a client request. This often results in client-side timeouts or connection errors.

The `server.js` file contains the buggy code, while `serverSolution.js` presents a more robust solution.

## The Problem

The original code lacks proper error handling and resource management. If an unhandled exception occurs during request processing, or if the server process is abruptly terminated (e.g., due to a system crash or `kill` command), the response might not be fully sent, leaving the client hanging.

## The Solution

The improved code includes comprehensive error handling using `try...catch` blocks and employs event listeners to gracefully handle server termination, ensuring that existing requests are completed or handled appropriately.
